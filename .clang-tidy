#### Disabled checks and why: #####
#
# -readability-convert-member-functions-to-static,
#     This check started going off in the upgrade from clang-tidy-8 to clang-tidy-12.  It is not always correct because
#     we hide the reference implementation in another repository.
# -clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.rand, -clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.rand, -bugprone-unhandled-self-assignment,
# -bugprone-implicit-widening-of-multiplication-result
#     These have not been investigated yet.
# -bugprone-reserved-identifier,
#     Fails due to use of some __SHORT_FILE__ symbol, originating from very old code.
# -bugprone-suspicious-include,
#     False positive due to GTest code.
# -bugprone-too-small-loop-variable,
#     Complains about uint8_t or uint16_t when the limit on the loop is a container's .size() (size_t).
#     We usually do this when we know the maximum size of the container though, so propose leaving disabled.
# -clang-analyzer-cplusplus.NewDelete,
#     Seems to generate false positives. Suggest relying on ASAN and valgrind for memory stuff.
# -clang-analyzer-cplusplus.NewDeleteLeaks,
#     Seems to generate false positives. Suggest relying on ASAN and valgrind for memory stuff.
# -modernize-use-nodiscard,
#     New C++17 feature, slightly polarizing. Would clutter codebase.
# -modernize-avoid-c-arrays,
#     Let's not deal with people doing ridiculous things to hack around this. If it bites them, it bites them.
# -bugprone-signed-char-misuse, -clang-diagnostic-implicit-int-float-conversion, -readability-make-member-function-const,
# -readability-qualified-auto, -readability-redundant-access-specifiers
#     These were previously disabled for not being available in clang-tidy-8. They are now available on our clang-tidy-12,
#     and potentially worth investigating/fixing.
# -bugprone-exception-escape
#     Weird. No idea how to resolve.
# -bugprone-branch-clone,
#    frequent misidentification
# -google-default-arguments
#    Too many virtual functions in pika have default parameters, specifically void Do(std::shared_ptr<Partition> partition = nullptr)
# -clang-analyzer-cplusplus.InnerPointer
#     I don't know why this bug in the RocksDB library fails to suppress detection.So I have to disable this check.
#--google-explicit-constructor
#     There are so many implicit convert in pika
#--use_of_tag_name_without_tag
#     like class member is class , If there is no class tag, an error will be reported
#     class A{  B b_;  } -> error ;  class A{  class B b_;  } -> no error ;
#-clang-analyzer-core.CallAndMessage
#     pika/src/storage/src/scope_record_lock.h
#     Always detect a null pointer and call the TryLock method
#     Called C++ object pointer is null [clang-analyzer-core.CallAndMessage,-warnings-as-errors]
#     lock_mgr_->UnLock(key);
#-clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores
#    error detection in some places
#-google-runtime-int
#    todo discussed, because there are so many of `long` and `long long` in pika, so disable for now
#-clang-diagnostic-unused-command-line-argument
#    because there are to many compile command error in github ci, but no error in local environment
#    See in build folder compile_commands.json
#-clang-diagnostic-ignored-optimization-argument
#    The reason disabled this is same as above.
